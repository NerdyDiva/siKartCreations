A reflection of my inner world, and of how I am affected by people, my environment. I do not discriminate in my creativity. I am inspired by my dreams, as well as by innocence and darkness. Every aspect of life, that which is seen and un-seen, are the catalysts that fuel my artistic endeavors.” </p>

                   <h2>Bio</h2>
                   <p>
                    Jeannie is a transplant to Utah. She moved here in January of 1991. She was born in Manhattan, NY, and grew up in Roselle, NJ. At the age of four, she discovered her artistic ability. She loved to sketch and found that drawing was effortless for her. She got into trouble often for drawing and writing on the apartment complex brick walls where she lived. Her love of art was nurtured by her grandfather, and an elementary school art teacher. She continued her pursuit of art throughout high school, but upon graduation found fulltime employment within the auto assembly industry.

                    During the early 1980's, Jeannie was laid off from General Motors Corporation in Linden, NJ. In finding herself on the unemployment line, she saw this as her opportunity to pursue art as a profession. She was accepted to attend DuCret School of the Arts in Plainfield, NJ, where she studied Commercial Art fulltime for one year. During this time, she was one of the top three artists in her class, and on the Dean's List. Due to financial obligations, she was unable to complete the remaining two-year curriculum. She was lucky to find employment working as a Freehand Color Separator of Textile Designs (wall covering, material, shower curtains, beach towels, etc.) within the Gravure/Rotary printing industry. This involved using only a paint brush and lithographers opaque. This type of work was beneficial in preparing her to master the art of painting. Jeannie continued working in this industry for 9 years, in-house and freelance, as well as doing fine art and illustrations.
                    
                    Jeannie's creative process ranges from simple to complex. Her work is diverse in execution and style, preferring abstract/symbolic art, and the surreal. She also loves realism and graffiti art. Jeannie can create in any medium, but currently works primarily in acrylic, pencil and oil. Pencil portraits of animals and people are also passion of hers. Sculpture is a future interest, as well as spray paint graffiti art on canvas. Jeannie also writes poetry, and loves taking old-school photos with her 35mm. She has many aspirations and will continue to seek out new avenues of expression.
                    
                    Jeannie has exhibited in various shows throughout the years within different venues, including the NAMI Artists Project, Sugarhouse Gallery, The Patrick Moore Gallery, Contemporary Design & Art Gallery, Museum of Utah Art & History for Salt Lake Community College's President's Art Show, Limner Gallery in NYC and the Bella Gallery. Most recently with the West Valley Cultural Center.

                    <h2>Current</h2>
                    <p>
                    I am currently working on a series of outer space/universe paintings. I’ve submitted one in the series, Cross My Heart, to the upcoming juried Women’s Show to be held at the West Valley Cultural Center. 
                    I have several portrait projects to complete as well.
